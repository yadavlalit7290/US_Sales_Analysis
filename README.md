# XYZ Co. 2014‚Äì2018 Sales Data EDA and Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project for the XYZ Co. regional sales dataset (2014‚Äì2018). This project was built to uncover actionable insights, analyze performance trends, and support strategic decision-making using advanced analytics and interactive data visualization.

---

## üìä Project Overview

### Objective
- Analyze historical sales data to identify revenue and profit drivers
- Understand seasonal and regional sales trends
- Detect anomalies and underperformance
- Deliver strategic business recommendations through insights and dashboards

### Deliverables
- Detailed EDA using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- Insight generation for growth, optimization, and risk reduction
- Power BI dashboard for executive-level exploration and storytelling

---

## üß∞ Data Sources
This project integrates multiple structured datasets:

- **Sales Orders**
- **Customers** 
- **Products** 
- **Regions** 
- **State Regions** 
- **2017 Budgets** 

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Merging
- Standardized column naming conventions
- Merged sheets to enrich transactions with customer, product, and geographic metadata
- Handled missing values and removed redundant or inconsistent data

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Total Cost**: Captures expense per line item
- **Profit & Profit Margin**: Profitability metrics
- **Order Month (Name & Number)**: Enables time-series and seasonal analyses

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Key Analyses:
- **Seasonality**: Identified monthly revenue cycles, year-over-year patterns
- **Outliers**: E.g., February 2017 dip in revenue
- **Product/Customer/Channel Rankings**: Focused on revenue concentration
- **Geographic Trends**: Regional/state sales breakdowns
- **Order Value & Profitability**: Distribution of order sizes and profitability influencers
- **Budget Comparison**: Analyzed 2017 actual vs. planned targets

#### Visualizations:
- Line plots, bar charts, pie charts, histograms
- Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Interactive dashboard with slicers for year, product, region, and sales channel
- Drill-through features for deep-dive analysis
- Executive summary views for quick insight

## üåü Key Insights & Recommendations

### Seasonality
- Spring slowdowns and mid-year peaks suggest promotional calendar optimization

### Product Strategy
- Top products (e.g., Product 25 & 26) are key revenue drivers; expand them further
- Improve marketing and distribution for mid-tier products

### Channel Strategy
- Heavy reliance on wholesale; recommend developing export and distributor channels

### Geographic Strategy
- West region leads revenue; Northeast underperforms
- Tailor region-specific go-to-market strategies

### Customer Management
- Top-tier customers generate the bulk of revenue
- Design loyalty and upsell programs for top clients, engagement campaigns for others

### Profitability Drivers
- Strong price-to-profit correlation
- Revisit pricing strategies to optimize margins without sacrificing volume

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data exploration 
- **Excel**: Raw data sources and budget tracking

---

## üöÄ Why This Project Stands Out
- **Business-Focused Analytics**: All analysis is tied to real-world business implications
- **Full Data Workflow**: From ingestion to insight to visualization
- **Reproducible & Modular**: Clean code, well-commented, and easy to extend
